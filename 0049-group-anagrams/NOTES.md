This question branches from valid anagram question as
the valid anagram question we have to count the characters and then we have to check for the count in both strings
but here we have to take the similar approach and store the count of the sorted string as the key value and then compare other sorted keys to the current sorted key if present store it in the map otherwise skip.
Other way include to create our own sort function..
