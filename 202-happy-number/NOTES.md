In this there are two main techniques used
1. Hashset approach
2. Floyd Cycle approach
The Hashset approach requires O(log n) time and O(log n) space while the floyd cycle take O(log n) time and O(1) space.
In this approach we should remember that there is an implicit(internal) linked list forming which we implement using the function calls.
Also in Floyd Cycle ,Initially we take the value of slow to the value given and fast to the value return from function called.
