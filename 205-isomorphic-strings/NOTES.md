In this question we need to check for one to one relationship between characters of two strings so we need two maps
â€‹
step 1: Create two maps:
i.) first map: for first string characters to be mapped to second string characters.
ii.) second map :for second string characters to be mapped to first string characters.
step 2: Check if the value of one map to the other map if both map to each other than the strings are isomporphic otherwise not.
